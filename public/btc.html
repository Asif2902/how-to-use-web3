        <h3>What is Bitcoin?</h3>
        <p>
            Bitcoin is a type of digital money, often called a cryptocurrency. It allows people to send and receive 
            money over the internet without needing a bank. Instead of being controlled by any government or 
            organization, Bitcoin operates on a technology called blockchain.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Where Does Bitcoin Exist?</h3>
        <p>
            Bitcoin exists entirely online. It doesn't have a physical form like cash or coins. Instead, it is stored 
            in digital wallets, which can be software-based or hardware devices. These wallets allow users to send 
            and receive Bitcoin through their unique addresses, similar to an email address. The entire Bitcoin network 
            operates on computers around the world, known as nodes, that validate and record transactions on the blockchain.

    <section>
        <h3>How Does Bitcoin Work?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Blockchain:</strong> Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain. 
                This is like a digital notebook that everyone can see but cannot change. Each page in the notebook is called 
                a block, and all the blocks together form the chain.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Decentralization:</strong> There is no single authority (like a bank) controlling Bitcoin. Instead, 
                thousands of computers around the world (called nodes) work together to maintain the blockchain. This makes 
                it decentralized and resistant to censorship.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Mining:</strong> Miners are special computers that solve complex math problems to validate 
                transactions. When they successfully solve a problem, they add a new block to the blockchain and are rewarded 
                with newly created Bitcoin. This process is known as mining.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Why is Bitcoin the Future?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Digital Currency:</strong> As the world moves more online, having a digital currency like Bitcoin makes sense. It allows for fast, easy, and borderless transactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Supply:</strong> There will only ever be twenty-one million Bitcoin. This scarcity can drive value, much like gold. As more people want to use Bitcoin, its value may increase.</li>
            <li><strong>Investment Opportunities:</strong> Many people view Bitcoin as a good investment. Some believe it can act like "digital gold," a safe haven for wealth in uncertain times.</li>
            <li><strong>Adoption:</strong> More businesses and people are starting to accept Bitcoin as payment. As acceptance grows, it may become a more common way to buy goods and services.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Why is Bitcoin So Secure?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cryptography:</strong> Bitcoin uses strong mathematical techniques to secure transactions. This makes it nearly impossible for someone to forge or manipulate the records.</li>
            <li><strong>Decentralized Network:</strong> Since no single person or organization controls Bitcoin, it is hard to attack or shut down. Even if some computers go offline, the network remains intact.</li>
            <li><strong>Proof of Work:</strong> The mining process requires a lot of computational power, making it costly to attack the network. A malicious actor would need to control more than half of the network to alter transactions, which is extremely difficult and expensive.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Who Maintains Bitcoin?</h3>
        <p>
            Bitcoin is maintained by a community of developers, miners, and node operators. Developers propose changes and 
            improvements, while miners secure the network by validating transactions. Node operators run Bitcoin software 
            to independently verify all transactions and blocks.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Who Has Full Authority Over Bitcoin?</h3>
        <p>
            No one has full authority over Bitcoin. It is a decentralized system, meaning no single person or group controls 
            it. The power lies with the entire community of users and participants. Decisions are made through consensus, 
            which means most participants need to agree before changes happen.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Is Bitcoin Owned by a Single Person?</h3>
        <p>
            Bitcoin is not owned by any single person. It was created by an anonymous individual or group of people known 
            as Satoshi Nakamoto. After the creation, Satoshi handed over control to the community. Since then, Bitcoin has 
            been developed and maintained by a decentralized group of contributors.
        </p>
    </section>


    <section>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Bitcoin is an innovative form of digital currency with the potential to change how we think about money. Its 
            security, decentralization, and growing acceptance make it an exciting option for the future. Understanding 
            how Bitcoin works can help you appreciate its potential in our digital world.
